This project aims to generate every possible password combination of any length and any combination of letters and numbers.

⚠️⚠️ WARNING!! This program creates AMAZINGLY large file sizes. I'm not just talking a couple Gigabytes... In some cases it can become Terabytes! A password that would have 23 Trillion Combinations with the format ------XXX where the letters could be upper case or lower case. Would be 458.38 Petabytes!!! ⚠️⚠️
